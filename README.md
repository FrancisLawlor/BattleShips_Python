### Play the game:

* Players are assigned ships at random positions on their side of the board. Each ship has its own corresponding letter - F occupies one position, D occupies two positions, C occupies three positions and D occupies four positions.
* The opponent's ships are masked during each player's turn.
* Players take turns selecting co-ordinates on their opponent's side of the board.
* When a player guesses a position it is marked with an X.
* When a player has successfully guessed each of his/her opponents occupied positions correctly he/she wins.
